7/14/21, 6:51 PM - +91 79883 12453: I thought so, but Macquarie representative informed you can enroll in 2 as that is minimum. I was confused because of that only

7/14/21, 6:52 PM - +66 93 130 2124: According to this website it is 3 units but if it is still unclear then you could send them an email to be sure
7/14/21, 6:53 PM - +92 313 9444543: <Media omitted>
7/14/21, 6:53 PM - +91 96549 44799: I had spoken to the student representative for this issue And he said you can even choose 1unit but you have to inform the university regarding this choice and then they'll decide if it's valid
7/14/21, 6:54 PM - +91 79883 12453: As per this link as well, 30 credit pointa are for domestic students. There is nothing specified for international one’s
7/14/21, 6:55 PM - +92 313 9444543: <Media omitted>
7/14/21, 6:55 PM - +92 313 9444543: See i am enrolled in one unit only.

7/14/21, 6:59 PM - +91 98990 32154: I have a question what’s the point of enrolling in less units ??
7/14/21, 6:59 PM - +91 98990 32154: We have to complete it in the same amount of time.
7/14/21, 7:00 PM - +92 313 9444543: So once you get enrolled in less units. The degree changes from full time to part time. And you can apply for extension before 3 months your visa expiration.
7/14/21, 7:00 PM - +92 313 9444543: And you can also extend your study duration

7/15/21, 4:13 PM - +91 96549 44799: We also payed 16900 but our SSAF of 156 is above that amount
7/15/21, 4:15 PM - Arnav Bajaj: Yeah i believe it is 116 for him since he converted his degree into part time
7/15/21, 4:16 PM - +92 313 9444543: Yea. It might be that reason.

7/18/21, 7:32 PM - +92 313 9444543: What is that for
7/18/21, 7:32 PM - +91 99007 15919: https://discord.gg/5UtWPNu
7/18/21, 7:34 PM - +91 99007 15919: You need that app to attend the Virtual Student Groups Showcase event. Try to get used to how to navigate through the app, it's a bit different than the usual chatting apps hue
7/18/21, 7:35 PM - +91 99007 15919: once you download it, join this group to attend the event!
7/18/21, 7:35 PM - +91 83685 29300: Okay sneh Ma’am 😂✌🏼
7/18/21, 7:38 PM - +91 99007 15919: 😂😂😂 You're welcome Kshi
7/18/21, 7:39 PM - +92 313 9444543: This is just for macquarie or just a common app
7/18/21, 7:40 PM - +91 99007 15919: It's a common app but Macquarie is conducting that event on this app since it's more chill and informal, so students can get to know each other a little better.
7/18/21, 7:42 PM - +91 99007 15919: People usually use it to communicate while video gaming or they form certain servers which is like a whatsapp group only but it can withhold all the participants on video call, voice call or just general chatting. You can stream movies, videos, games and music while chatting with your friends hue
7/18/21, 7:42 PM - +91 99007 15919: I feel like I am advertising the app a bit much
7/18/21, 7:42 PM - +91 99007 15919: just download it and check it out for yourselves xD
7/18/21, 7:43 PM - +91 99007 15919: If ya'll want to get familiarised with how the app works, we can create a server on that app as well for Indians at Macquarie

7/20/21, 11:07 AM - +91 83685 29300: Yesss
7/20/21, 11:16 AM - +91 98919 94456: No Indian society?
7/20/21, 11:16 AM - +91 83685 29300: Shall we create one?
7/20/21, 11:16 AM - +91 98919 94456: Ofcourse
7/20/21, 11:17 AM - +91 98919 94456: There is so much we can do in that
7/20/21, 11:17 AM - +91 95184 35856: It's on Facebook?
7/20/21, 11:17 AM - +91 96549 44799: Let we be the creators of something!!
7/20/21, 11:17 AM - +91 98919 94456: The list doesn’t have any Indian or India related society
7/20/21, 11:17 AM - +91 98919 94456: Which comes as a shock tbh
7/20/21, 11:17 AM - +91 95184 35856: I saw a Tamil society
7/20/21, 11:18 AM - +91 83685 29300: Yesss i think creating our society will be beneficial for us aswell as the upcoming students
7/20/21, 11:18 AM - +91 98919 94456: I believe after China, Indians are the next most admitted students
7/20/21, 11:18 AM - +91 96549 44799: We starting a whole new initiative
7/20/21, 11:18 AM - +91 96549 44799: Yeahh
7/20/21, 11:18 AM - +91 98703 38621: Yess
7/20/21, 11:19 AM - +91 95184 35856: Can anyone ask an old or current student about the same
7/20/21, 11:19 AM - +91 95184 35856: Maybe we already have an Indian society
7/20/21, 11:19 AM - +91 95184 35856: It seems unlikely to not have a society
7/20/21, 11:19 AM - +91 98919 94456: Yeah possibly there could be
7/20/21, 11:20 AM - +91 95184 35856: If this also exists
7/20/21, 11:20 AM - +91 98919 94456: Even they have a society for KPOP ffs
7/20/21, 11:20 AM - +91 83685 29300: I’ve come across
7/20/21, 11:20 AM - +91 95184 35856: 🤣🤣
7/20/21, 11:20 AM - +91 96549 44799: Yeah I was shocked to see this
7/20/21, 11:20 AM - +91 98919 94456: Nothing against anyone who is a BTS fan 😂
7/20/21, 11:20 AM - +91 83685 29300: Dilwale Indian Macquarie society
7/20/21, 11:21 AM - +91 95184 35856: Du has bajrang dal so it evens out
7/20/21, 11:21 AM - +91 98919 94456: But the list suggested by the mentors didn’t have anything to do with Indians
7/20/21, 11:21 AM - +91 96549 44799: I guess this would be it
7/20/21, 11:21 AM - +91 83685 29300: 😂😂
7/20/21, 11:21 AM - +91 98919 94456: We need to attract people, not scare them 😂
7/20/21, 11:22 AM - +91 83685 29300: We need public friendly society not a menace 😂
7/20/21, 11:22 AM - +91 98919 94456: But we should if it isn’t
7/20/21, 11:23 AM - +91 98919 94456: I think it would be there definitely
7/20/21, 11:23 AM - +91 83685 29300: <Media omitted>
7/20/21, 11:23 AM - +91 98919 94456: It’s our own benefit tbh
7/20/21, 11:23 AM - +91 98919 94456: Effort and time saved
7/20/21, 11:24 AM - +91 95184 35856: Could have managed to put two or three more letters here
7/20/21, 11:25 AM - +91 98919 94456: https://instagram.com/dilwalemq?utm_medium=copy_link
7/20/21, 11:28 AM - +91 98919 94456: Inactive society
7/20/21, 11:28 AM - +91 83685 29300: Maybe due to covid and all
7/20/21, 11:28 AM - +91 83685 29300: Who knows 🙃 7/20/21, 11:56 AM - +61 425 125 786 left
7/20/21, 11:57 AM - +91 98919 94456: Whatever it being, atleast if pay well and are in large numbers, we must have a representation of some sorts
7/20/21, 11:59 AM - +91 98919 94456: One of the valuable things i learned from working with the Chinese and the British
7/20/21, 12:01 PM - +91 83685 29300: But on a personal level i think we should join a society which help us in our career.
7/20/21, 12:01 PM - +91 83685 29300: But the point which you made also makes sense .
7/20/21, 12:05 PM - +91 98919 94456: I don’t know how a Kanye west society propels a career
7/20/21, 12:06 PM - +91 98919 94456: But anyhow
7/20/21, 12:06 PM - +91 98919 94456: Societies specifically for career are important as well
7/20/21, 12:06 PM - +91 83685 29300: That’s bullshit in my opinion
7/20/21, 12:07 PM - +91 98919 94456: Career specific societies are very less in number as to what I saw
7/20/21, 12:07 PM - +91 98919 94456: Just about 3-4
7/20/21, 12:08 PM - +91 98919 94456: Depending on the subject
7/20/21, 12:08 PM - +91 96549 44799: Mostly are extra curricular sorts
7/20/21, 12:08 PM - +91 83685 29300: Until or unless that group is dedicated to how kanye made his business bloom and what are his marketing strategies etc.
7/20/21, 12:08 PM - +91 83685 29300: Yessss
7/20/21, 12:08 PM - +91 83685 29300: Which i think won’t be the case😂
7/20/21, 12:08 PM - +91 98919 94456: 😂😂
7/20/21, 12:08 PM - +91 98919 94456: Eezys
7/20/21, 12:08 PM - +91 96549 44799: Subjective societies are usually less attractive than rest
7/20/21, 12:09 PM - +91 98919 94456: Plus you might start something from the scratch
7/20/21, 12:09 PM - +91 98919 94456: That is a career propeller IMO
7/20/21, 12:09 PM - +91 98919 94456: For the community
7/20/21, 12:09 PM - +91 83685 29300: I am down for it tho
7/20/21, 12:09 PM - +91 98919 94456: And add words like equality diversity and inclusiveness
7/20/21, 12:10 PM - +91 98919 94456: Hot words
7/20/21, 12:11 PM - +91 98919 94456: I can tell you from first hand experience that you don’t want to known for just naan bread and chaa 😂
7/20/21, 12:21 PM - +91 83685 29300: Discord students group showcas we can get insights from there
7/20/21, 12:27 PM - +91 98919 94456: I asked an old student
7/20/21, 12:27 PM - +91 98919 94456: Senior to my course
7/20/21, 12:28 PM - +91 83685 29300: If we need to start first we need to confirm the existence of other indian societies and whether they are active or not.  As an affiliated student group of Macquarie University, all student groups should have their membership open to all students and staff also.  We’ll need a minimum of 20 students to start our own society and 75% of them should be enrolled.  We’ll need a president, treasurer and a secretary and then we can make other sub committees and roles but these 3 are mandatory.
7/20/21, 12:30 PM - +91 98919 94456: Yeah that dilwale group charged close to 10 dollars for membership
7/20/21, 12:30 PM - +91 98919 94456: And it isn’t much active
7/20/21, 12:30 PM - +91 98919 94456: Plus not affiliated
7/20/21, 12:33 PM - +91 98919 94456: Sounds right 👌
7/20/21, 12:45 PM - +91 83685 29300: Who all got the verification email for discord?

7/20/21, 2:01 PM - +91 99007 15919: The resume building one
7/20/21, 2:01 PM - +233 26 077 8603: This was my first seminar and was really great
7/20/21, 2:01 PM - +91 99007 15919: Don't worry, you can always watch the recorded one
7/20/21, 2:01 PM - +91 96549 44799: Yeah

7/20/21, 2:02 PM - +91 99007 15919: That's okay! Just watch the recorded one, it was so informative 😌
7/20/21, 2:02 PM - +91 96549 44799: I guess you can still watch the recorded one
7/20/21, 2:02 PM - +66 93 130 2124: How can we watch it again? Any idea?

7/20/21, 2:13 PM - +91 98703 38621: Many societies are paid, and those societies have 90% on campus events/meetings. I think it'll be waste of money to enroll in them while being offshore.
7/20/21, 2:16 PM - +91 99007 15919: Anytime ✨ I gotchu
7/20/21, 2:16 PM - +91 99007 15919: wait for the virtual showcase before enrolling right away
7/20/21, 2:17 PM - +91 99007 15919: you will know more then and can decide whether to enrol or not
7/20/21, 2:17 PM - +91 94271 35431: Yes you are right
7/20/21, 2:17 PM - +91 94271 35431: Do anyone have phys1510 as a unit in your course?
7/20/21, 2:17 PM - +233 26 077 8603: Ok
7/20/21, 2:18 PM - +91 98703 38621: Yes exactly. It'll be stupidity to pay now. Because I've checked there page and there were posts of only in person meetings
7/20/21, 2:24 PM - +66 93 130 2124: Well you do realize that we compulsory pay for them through our SSAF Fees every year which is 300AUD so it is waste of money if you don’t enroll in any of them and also joining any clubs or societies is great to add in your resume because you might never know your employer might have actually been part of it and stuff
7/20/21, 2:24 PM - +91 99007 15919: sweets, I think you need to pay separately for the societies :(
7/20/21, 2:25 PM - +91 99007 15919: SSAF covers other services
7/20/21, 2:25 PM - +91 98703 38621: Exactly. +1
7/20/21, 2:25 PM - +91 99007 15919: clubs and societies are to be paid for by us
7/20/21, 2:26 PM - +91 99007 15919: but I agree with the fact that being involved in a club will look good on your resume and will also benefit you as a person to grow and learn more
7/20/21, 2:26 PM - +91 99007 15919: plus you also make good friends
7/20/21, 2:26 PM - +91 98703 38621: Yes, I have read the guidelines, SSAF covers other things not societies

7/20/21, 2:28 PM - +91 98919 94456: Even some links to books and other material
7/20/21, 2:30 PM - +66 93 130 2124: Well let’s see we will get to know about it maybe there are some clubs where you don’t need to pay anything  we will get to know by Thursday
7/20/21, 2:30 PM - +91 99007 15919: yess correct 😌✌🏾

7/20/21, 2:34 PM - +91 99007 15919: I agree, which is why joining 2-3 clubs really does benefit you

7/25/21, 3:10 AM - +91 98198 65393: This is nuts! And the protests in Sydney was totally ridiculous. Don’t think I ever expected Sydney to be in news for such reasons to be honest. 😥
7/25/21, 3:10 AM - +66 93 130 2124: 🙄🙄
7/25/21, 3:12 AM - +91 98198 65393: There was a photo clicked where one protestor is seen punching a police horse. A horse!!! 😡
7/25/21, 3:16 AM - +91 83685 29300: Yess that’s pretty ugly what’s happening down there in sydney.
7/25/21, 3:16 AM - +91 83685 29300: That’s disturbing wth!!

7/25/21, 2:04 PM - +91 95184 35856: 🧐🧐
7/25/21, 2:05 PM - +91 95184 35856: Can anyone explain me the difference between a lecture and a tutorial
7/25/21, 2:06 PM - +91 95184 35856: If there are 4 units that means I have 8 classes to attend
7/25/21, 2:06 PM - +91 95184 35856: But all my units have only one zoom link of the tutorial
7/25/21, 2:07 PM - +91 98703 38621: Same. I'm not understanding it. Only one, one hour tutorial in whole week
7/25/21, 2:07 PM - +91 98703 38621: How can this be possible? Can someone please explain
7/25/21, 2:16 PM - +91 95184 35856: lectures are just sessions where the conveyor teaches the content tutorial is where ur with other people and a tutor explains the content lectures are never mandatory as u can watch them later but tutorials can be mandatory depending on unit
7/25/21, 2:16 PM - +91 95184 35856: from discord
7/25/21, 2:16 PM - Arnav Bajaj: There should be another link for lecture as well
7/25/21, 2:17 PM - Arnav Bajaj: Some units might not have a zoom link but the convenor might just upload the videos to i learn
7/25/21, 2:17 PM - +91 95184 35856: these are prerecorded resources
7/25/21, 2:17 PM - +91 95184 35856: ilearn is very tedious to navigate
7/25/21, 2:18 PM - +91 98703 38621: +1
7/25/21, 3:00 PM - +66 93 130 2124: @919518435856 I don’t understand what you are confused about when it comes to zoom links
7/25/21, 3:00 PM - +66 93 130 2124: …
7/25/21, 3:01 PM - +66 93 130 2124: If you go to your ilearn you will see each units has a section called delivery format
7/25/21, 3:01 PM - +66 93 130 2124: Where the lecturer or unit instructor mentions the ways the unit will be conducted for the session
7/25/21, 3:02 PM - +66 93 130 2124: <Media omitted>
7/25/21, 3:10 PM - +91 98919 94456: So lectures are pre recorded
7/25/21, 3:10 PM - +91 98919 94456: Whereas tutorials are live?
7/25/21, 3:10 PM - +91 98919 94456: And estudent usually shows lectures mostly, with one or two exceptions of a tutorial
7/25/21, 3:11 PM - +91 98919 94456: Any idea on that?
7/25/21, 3:11 PM - +61 450 371 348: Since it's online almost everything is recorded
7/25/21, 3:11 PM - +61 450 371 348: Lectures, Tutorials, SGTAs
7/25/21, 3:12 PM - +91 98919 94456: We got the mail that one hour tutorials will be usually live
7/25/21, 3:13 PM - +61 450 371 348: The first class will explain all of this
7/25/21, 3:13 PM - +91 98919 94456: So that takes me to the schedule that is mentioned on estudent, do the timings mentioned on the portal matter?
7/25/21, 3:14 PM - +61 450 371 348: But as far as I have experienced everything is recorded
7/25/21, 3:14 PM - +91 98919 94456: Coz one of the lectures start at 4:30 am IST as per the estudent
7/25/21, 3:15 PM - +91 98198 65393: Welcome to my world! Hahaha yes they are all according to Sydney time. While tutorials and lectures are usually recorded, it is best to confirm with your convenor. My convenor who’s taking the 4.30 am tute has no plans of recording any of the sessions so far 😒
7/25/21, 3:16 PM - +91 98198 65393: They = timings
7/25/21, 3:17 PM - +91 98919 94456: Thanks for the clarification. LOL
7/25/21, 3:17 PM - +91 98919 94456: But yes
7/25/21, 3:17 PM - +91 98198 65393: Haha figured
7/25/21, 3:17 PM - +91 98919 94456: Convenors did mail us I believe
7/25/21, 3:17 PM - +91 98919 94456: They mentioned about the delivery part and all
7/25/21, 3:17 PM - +91 98198 65393: Hence clarified :)
7/25/21, 3:18 PM - +91 98919 94456: Most of them have recorded lectures and notes which can be referred easily
7/25/21, 3:18 PM - +91 98919 94456: So how is everyone planning to go about it?
7/25/21, 3:18 PM - +91 98198 65393: They may not always mentioned whether all lectures will be recorded so confirm it. There could also be different tutors and some may, while others may not record. It’s crazy I know! But it’s ok. Trouble them with it than be sorry 😊
7/25/21, 3:19 PM - +91 98919 94456: Absolutely correct
7/25/21, 3:20 PM - +91 98198 65393: This is my second sem. Most of my workshops/ tutorials in first semester were early in the morning according to IST. I honestly just changed my sleep cycle than to miss anything out. And keep checking ilearn daily.
7/25/21, 3:20 PM - +91 98198 65393: Starbucks earned lots of moolah in the beginning of the semester hahaha
7/25/21, 3:23 PM - +61 450 371 348: Checking emails and ilearn is the first thing you should do everyday
7/25/21, 3:23 PM - +61 450 371 348: Just so you don't miss any deadlines
7/25/21, 3:25 PM - +91 98919 94456: Noted sir 🤙
7/25/21, 3:26 PM - +91 98919 94456: You can ask for more dividend on Tata consumers share maybe
7/25/21, 3:27 PM - +91 98198 65393: 😂😂

7/25/21, 11:53 PM - +971 50 770 6925: I don’t think there are live lectures. Only recorded ones
7/25/21, 11:53 PM - +971 50 770 6925: And then there are zoom links for tutorials
7/25/21, 11:54 PM - +91 95184 35856: Then why are there 8 classes in a week
7/25/21, 11:54 PM - +91 95184 35856: Of only 4 are live
7/25/21, 11:54 PM - +91 95184 35856: if the rest are recorded then why put them in the timetable
7/25/21, 11:55 PM - +971 50 770 6925: Yah I was wondering the same thing. But maybe thats when they upload that lecture
7/25/21, 11:55 PM - +971 50 770 6925: And its available for all of us to access
7/25/21, 11:56 PM - +971 50 770 6925: One of my profs uploaded a lecture last week itself🙄

7/25/21, 11:57 PM - +91 95184 35856: Was wondering what would I do in the first week then
7/25/21, 11:58 PM - +91 98919 94456: Practice to wake up early maybe
7/25/21, 11:58 PM - +91 98919 94456: And even sleep
7/25/21, 11:58 PM - +91 98919 94456: Early

7/26/21, 7:41 PM - +91 96297 54570: Yooo guys anyone out there! I have a doubt! There is a category of classes in timetable! One is Unit name, timing and campus address. Another one is unit name, timings and u online!  If I select the one with campus address , do they deliver it through online too or only in campus ? Do I need to enroll in only “u online” to get online deliver ?
7/26/21, 7:42 PM - +91 96549 44799: We have to select the online one
7/26/21, 7:42 PM - +91 96549 44799: That would be delivered in online mode to us
7/26/21, 7:42 PM - +91 96297 54570: What about the class with campus address ?
7/26/21, 7:43 PM - +91 96549 44799: They are to be delivered in offline mode

8/20/21, 3:44 AM - +91 81465 51031: Turnit in allows how many attempts? Before submitting the final one

8/20/21, 3:47 AM - +91 95184 35856: Sorry wrong group
8/20/21, 3:47 AM - +91 81465 51031: Okay so i guess it allows us to submit 3 times and it shows plagiarism % age
8/20/21, 3:47 AM - +91 81465 51031: 3rd time is final
8/20/21, 8:59 AM - +91 98198 65393: Depends from tutor to tutor. Some set it one submission only while others set it at multiple. Check with the tutor.
8/20/21, 9:00 AM - +91 98198 65393: Once you submit on turn it in, it will show the similarity percentage.
8/20/21, 12:45 PM - +91 81465 51031: Okay. Thank you!

8/22/21, 8:38 PM - +91 83685 29300: Has anyobody gone through studywise? Now it shows up in my units 😂 do i have to complete it?
8/23/21, 5:38 AM - +61 450 371 348: No
8/24/21, 4:08 AM - +971 50 770 6925: Heyy. Is this whole semester gonna be online for everyone?? Even domestic students?? I got some mail stating that but I’m confused
8/24/21, 4:09 AM - +61 450 371 348: Yes
8/24/21, 4:09 AM - +61 450 371 348: Until further updates, that's the case
8/24/21, 4:10 AM - +971 50 770 6925: Not to be rude. But isn’t it kinda dramatic that they shut down for 5+ months because they have a couple hundred cases
8/24/21, 4:11 AM - +61 450 371 348: It isn't, they wanna curb the number of cases as efficiently as possible
8/24/21, 4:11 AM - +61 450 371 348: It all depends on the number of people who will get vaccinated
8/24/21, 4:13 AM - +971 50 770 6925: I mean I get that. But its kinda shocking to me thats it. We survived like 100k cases a day
8/24/21, 4:13 AM - +971 50 770 6925: But makes sense
8/24/21, 4:13 AM - +61 450 371 348: Also they are just adhering to the regulations imposed by the government
8/24/21, 4:14 AM - +971 50 770 6925: Oh I hope they get that going soon.
8/24/21, 4:14 AM - +971 50 770 6925: Does lockdown not end in august? Is it gonna continue?
8/24/21, 4:15 AM - +61 450 371 348: It will continue
8/24/21, 4:15 AM - +61 450 371 348: The rules have become more stringent
8/24/21, 4:16 AM - +61 450 371 348: For more details https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/news/Pages/20210823_00.aspx
8/24/21, 4:20 AM - +971 50 770 6925: Ahhh😔 I hope it ends soon!
8/24/21, 2:05 PM - +66 93 130 2124: I understand your frustration but if you think about it Australia’s population is 25.36million which is only 1.86% population of India so then having a couple of hundreds of cases is actually alot not only that but their vaccination progression is relatively slow due to (I am guessing) not enough vaccines that is why they are getting stricter 😅 Plus in general Australia has always had a relatively strict law 😊
8/24/21, 2:21 PM - +91 99007 15919: I agree with Utkarsh and Mai. Whatever it takes to get their covid situation under control and open up borders sooner. If they wouldn't have implemented those restrictions, things would've gotten out of control and it would've taken longer for them to open up the borders. At least now, there is some hope that the borders might open in December once they're vaccinated but I won't jinx it hahaha 😅
8/24/21, 2:22 PM - +91 98703 38621: YES.. but not zinxingg🧿🧿🧿🧿🧿g it
8/24/21, 3:17 PM - +91 95184 35856: India had its lowest recorded cases at approx 26000
8/24/21, 3:17 PM - +91 95184 35856: 😅😅😅😅😅
8/24/21, 3:20 PM - +91 99007 15919: Just read that yess
8/24/21, 3:20 PM - +91 99007 15919: with a 97% recovery rate lmao

8/24/21, 8:37 PM - +971 50 770 6925: Yah. In a sense its really really good that they have effective government rules unlike other countries. And they have combated the situation really well. I was trying to look at it in a way that every country has accepted the fact that Covid isn’t going anywhere. So it’s good that we adapt to the situation and vaccines play a huge role in that Ofcourse. Which is why even though the delta variant is still a huge problem many countries don’t seem that bothered about it😂
8/24/21, 8:39 PM - +91 81465 51031: A friend of mine who applied for an internship for a company in Sydney while being here in india got rejected because they want the person to be there in Australia and not abroad. 😐
8/24/21, 9:46 PM - +91 92056 57412: Hey is anyone going in jan from Delhi gurgaon?

8/26/21, 3:58 PM - +66 93 130 2124: @919900715919Transit flight from Singapore will be good as long as there is no quarantine in Singapore 😅
8/26/21, 4:02 PM - +91 99007 15919: Singapore hasn't opened borders yet, I have a friend who was supposed to go study there but she's stuck here just like us. And even @918939933211
8/26/21, 4:02 PM - +91 99007 15919: But 90% of their population is vaccinated 💔
8/26/21, 4:06 PM - +61 450 371 348: 2 doses, bub?
8/26/21, 4:07 PM - +91 99007 15919: Haan both
8/26/21, 4:07 PM - +91 99007 15919: 97% single dose
8/26/21, 4:08 PM - +61 450 371 348: Well, look at this data scientist
8/26/21, 4:08 PM - +61 450 371 348: xD
8/26/21, 4:10 PM - +91 81465 51031: 75% is fully vaccinated
8/26/21, 4:12 PM - +91 81465 51031: 82% is partially
8/26/21, 4:19 PM - +66 93 130 2124: My brother lives in Singapore and he said they have 80% already vaccinated population
8/26/21, 4:20 PM - +66 93 130 2124: And they will transition to start hawkers, shopping areas and stuff soon
8/26/21, 4:21 PM - +66 93 130 2124: I think the reason your friend is not able to go to Singapore is because India hasn’t open their flights to other destinations
8/26/21, 4:23 PM - +66 93 130 2124: However there are some new sources saying that Singapore will open in September like this one https://www.india.com/travel/articles/international-travel-update-singapore-may-allow-quarantine-free-travel-from-september-4845304/
8/26/21, 4:24 PM - +66 93 130 2124: News*
8/26/21, 4:28 PM - +91 99007 15919: Eh man, @918939933211 and I saw the other day it was 97 SCAM
8/26/21, 4:28 PM - +91 99007 15919: Yess
8/26/21, 4:34 PM - +971 50 770 6925: Umm you do realize when they say from Singapore they mean Singapore nationals and residents
8/26/21, 4:35 PM - +971 50 770 6925: 😂😭
8/26/21, 4:42 PM - +66 93 130 2124: Not necessarily
8/26/21, 4:43 PM - +66 93 130 2124: That is why it is called ‘transit’ flight
8/26/21, 4:44 PM - +66 93 130 2124: You don’t need to be from Singapore or a resident also I said “if”
8/26/21, 4:44 PM - +61 450 371 348: No leaving Changi?
8/26/21, 4:44 PM - +66 93 130 2124: Well transit usually do mean that also I am guessing guys
8/26/21, 4:44 PM - +61 450 371 348: No, not always, you  can leave and come back
8/26/21, 4:45 PM - +66 93 130 2124: It depends na it depends on the time your flight is at 😅
8/26/21, 4:45 PM - +61 450 371 348: Indeed
8/26/21, 4:45 PM - +91 98198 65393: Indian passport holders can travel from Singapore as far as they have not been in india for a specific time before travelling to Australia. Based on what I have understood from my friends in Singapore.
8/26/21, 4:45 PM - +66 93 130 2124: Okay so I will go now itself 🤣🤣🤣
8/26/21, 4:46 PM - +91 98198 65393: This time could range from a week to a month depending on what the govt decides.

8/26/21, 4:46 PM - +91 98198 65393: Hahahaa for that too, you can not be in india for 21 days before entering Singapore. So add one more country ;)
8/26/21, 4:47 PM - +66 93 130 2124: Huh?
8/26/21, 4:47 PM - +91 98198 65393: Oh then you should be in luck. Check the Singapore website for their entry exemptions. Differs from country to country.
8/26/21, 4:48 PM - +66 93 130 2124: Lol what should I do going there right anyways if the travel bubble is not been announced for Australia yet
8/26/21, 4:48 PM - +66 93 130 2124: Now*

10/19/21, 3:31 PM - +91 81465 51031: I don’t understand why they can’t just open up. They did mention they’ll start return of students at 70%. Now it’s 80 and they’re starting in dec.
10/19/21, 3:31 PM - +91 81465 51031: Idiots

10/19/21, 4:07 PM - +91 99007 15919: They rejected me for December but they've put me on a waitlist for 2022
10/19/21, 4:08 PM - +91 95184 35856: Where is that
10/19/21, 4:08 PM - +91 81465 51031: I am on call with the university
10/19/21, 4:08 PM - +91 81465 51031: Asking them this

10/19/21, 4:08 PM - Kunal Macquarie Un: We didn't get seat in December pilot program maybe we will get Jan or Feb

10/19/21, 4:10 PM - +91 95184 35856: I guess then every one is in the waiting list
10/19/21, 4:11 PM - +92 313 9444543: Every single person is on waiting list, i am curious whether they actually bringing back students or all are on waiting list.
10/19/21, 4:13 PM - +971 50 770 6925: We should seriously send them mass emails and call them individually
10/19/21, 4:21 PM - +66 93 130 2124: I am guessing anyone who didn’t check boxes of December 2021 is on waiting list
10/19/21, 4:22 PM - +66 93 130 2124: Those who did will be on the pilot program for December 202-
10/19/21, 4:22 PM - +66 93 130 2124: 2021**
10/19/21, 4:23 PM - +91 95370 71395: same
10/19/21, 4:24 PM - +66 93 130 2124: I don’t think pushing the university will help in any sort in the end they still have to follow the government policies
10/19/21, 4:24 PM - +66 93 130 2124: Did you tick an option for December 2021?
10/19/21, 4:25 PM - +92 313 9444543: I have checked all the boxes of this coming. And i think most of the lads have done this.
10/19/21, 4:25 PM - +66 93 130 2124: Also it was mentioned in previous email before this one that priority will be given to students who are in their last semester as well
10/19/21, 4:25 PM - +66 93 130 2124: I checked for January and February
10/19/21, 4:26 PM - +66 93 130 2124: Only
10/19/21, 4:26 PM - +92 313 9444543: Yea. But these govt things and all, they are sending these mails from july 2020.
10/19/21, 4:27 PM - +66 93 130 2124: Are you enrolled since last year?
10/19/21, 4:28 PM - +92 313 9444543: Na, but I used to send them mails by asking what are they planning.
10/19/21, 4:28 PM - +66 93 130 2124: <Media omitted>
10/19/21, 4:28 PM - +66 93 130 2124: Also their plan is still not changed it is the same
10/19/21, 4:29 PM - +66 93 130 2124: Well they cannot predict how the disease will spread since last year
10/19/21, 4:29 PM - +66 93 130 2124: The only thing we can do is patience
10/19/21, 4:29 PM - +66 93 130 2124: I know we all frustrated
10/19/21, 4:30 PM - +92 313 9444543: Prediction is not the answer, at least a govt should know what the country situation will be in the coming 10 years
10/19/21, 4:30 PM - +66 93 130 2124: I think they know quite well but again plans can change
10/19/21, 4:31 PM - +92 313 9444543: There are other countries which are coping Covid very easily, Uk, Canada, USA, dubai. I would say modern problem needs modern solutions, Mai
10/19/21, 4:31 PM - +66 93 130 2124: if they have mentioned 80% then we have to wait
10/19/21, 4:32 PM - +91 81465 51031: Yea
10/19/21, 4:32 PM - +92 313 9444543: Yea. I hope they stick to their words🙌🏻
10/19/21, 4:32 PM - +66 93 130 2124: I don’t think so they are coping that well they have their issues
10/19/21, 4:33 PM - +66 93 130 2124: I understand that but think about it from the government side their priority will be to first protect their citizens and then the rest which is what they are doing.
10/19/21, 4:34 PM - +91 97173 76378: I emailed the university multiple times last week, and they mentioned that their hands are tied until the govt opens borders
10/19/21, 4:34 PM - +92 313 9444543: They are playing politics. A deep politics
10/19/21, 4:34 PM - +91 97173 76378: emailing the uni will serve no purpose
10/19/21, 4:34 PM - +66 93 130 2124: So 80% is what WHO and government has said then it is what it is
10/19/21, 4:35 PM - +92 313 9444543: Finger 🤞 🙌🏻
10/19/21, 4:35 PM - +66 93 130 2124: Then maybe you should email the government.
10/19/21, 4:36 PM - +92 313 9444543: I have never ever followed any country politics in my entire life, and i am following aus politics from January.
10/19/21, 4:37 PM - +92 313 9444543: Aus lost 34 billion dollars and they can make 37 in some months only by resuming domestic flights. No need to bother for opening borders😂
10/19/21, 4:38 PM - +66 93 130 2124: Good then maybe you should email from your side about it  I am good with waiting till they reach 80% which hopefully won’t take too long
10/19/21, 4:39 PM - +92 313 9444543: I wish we can bear a lill more and we will
10/19/21, 4:39 PM - +66 93 130 2124: They need open their international border because they university have lost a lot  international students profits  so don’t worry it will happen

10/19/21, 4:47 PM - +66 93 130 2124: So based on picture you just sent do you think they still don’t want student to come…
10/19/21, 4:48 PM - +92 313 9444543: Uni’s are loyal, Govt is playing politics. And you might have seen what premier of NSW said while PM just multiplied his view by zero in just hours.
10/19/21, 4:48 PM - +971 50 770 6925: It doesn’t matter if we come or not as long as our fees reach their account
10/19/21, 4:48 PM - +66 93 130 2124: We just need to be patient till 80%

10/19/21, 4:49 PM - +61 416 529 983: The premier didn’t have the authority to decide to remove quarantine. It’s a federal level decision

10/19/21, 4:50 PM - +66 93 130 2124: Look don’t need to tell me the politics if you have problem with policy talk directly to Australian embassy
10/19/21, 4:51 PM - +92 313 9444543: Guys, I am just opening up what are the matters involved in all this. Relax don’t be offended with it😂

10/19/21, 4:53 PM - +66 93 130 2124: Also I don’t have much knowledge about their politics play so not going to say anything about how it works as long as I have an complete understanding about it
10/19/21, 4:54 PM - +66 93 130 2124: If they have asked us to wait I will wait till 80%
10/19/21, 4:55 PM - +66 93 130 2124: Stressing about that right now is not priority for me right now getting my reports on time is 🥲
10/19/21, 4:57 PM - +92 313 9444543: One should demand for their rights too. We are not only paying to sit in home countries and paying full fees, covering their bills while not using them at all. On a lighter note😕
10/19/21, 5:09 PM - +91 98703 38621: May I remind our policy makers that Australian voters do not support the mass return of international students, nor a return to pre-COVID levels of immigration.  This was made abundantly clear in the latest survey from the The Australian Population Research Institute (TAPRI), which showed that 70% of Australians oppose a return to pre-COVID levels of immigration. https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2021/10/plans-submitted-to-flood-australia-with-international-students/

10/19/21, 7:43 PM - +91 95184 35856: Because 500 can easily be taken in 1 flight
10/19/21, 8:48 PM - Arjun Macquarie Uni: 500 people won’t be allowed to travel in a single flight. Only limited passengers can travel in a single flight because of social distancing
10/19/21, 8:51 PM - Arjun Macquarie Uni: ^this is what people working in the airline industry are saying

11/12/21, 3:07 PM - Arnav Bajaj: This might help - https://students.mq.edu.au/study/enrolling/session-3
11/12/21, 3:48 PM - +61 451 669 592: Depends on your degree but do check whether there's a higher fee for it.
11/12/21, 3:49 PM - +61 451 669 592: In previous years they charge like a higher fee for students (since it's summer time), but this might have changed.

11/12/21, 7:14 PM - +91 99007 15919: It's just for the international students. Since tourists aren't permitted to set foot on their land yet.
11/12/21, 7:14 PM - +91 95184 35856: Tourists are humans as well right
11/12/21, 7:14 PM - +91 95184 35856: Not too different to australian citizens
11/12/21, 7:19 PM - +91 98703 38621: How will they manage 250 students from 7 different countries? 🤦🏻‍♀️

6/18/22, 1:30 PM - +61 414 446 798: Hey guys  Just wanted to confirm does Allianz OSHC covers hospital stays?
6/18/22, 1:30 PM - +61 414 446 798: Thank you in advance
6/18/22, 4:16 PM - +61 451 669 592: Not sure if you got the answer to your question already but it looks like it covers your admission into hospital, but not the hospital stay itself.
6/18/22, 4:17 PM - +61 451 669 592: It depends on your level of cover but at face value it looks like it covers the admission aspects (the ambulance and the cost of actually being admitted into a public/private hospital).
